# CI/CD Performance Tuning

> Faster pipelines mean faster feedback — and faster feedback means stronger delivery confidence.

## Overview

CI/CD pipelines are the heartbeat of any modern engineering workflow. When tuned right, they provide fast feedback loops, early bug detection, and reliable deployments. When left unchecked, they can easily become sluggish, inconsistent, and costly.

In this post, we’ll explore **five tuning strategies** that make your pipelines both faster and smarter.

## 1. Profile Before You Optimize

Before changing anything, **measure**. Use your CI/CD provider’s analytics (like GitHub Actions’ job timings or Jenkins’ build stats) to see where time is really spent.

- Identify **slowest jobs and steps**.  
- Detect redundant builds or dependency downloads.  
- Watch for unstable jobs that frequently retry or hang.

> A rule of thumb: Never optimize blind. A slow build may not be CPU-bound — it might be I/O or network-limited.

## 2. Cache Everything You Can (But Wisely)

Caching is the single biggest performance multiplier for most pipelines.  
- Cache **dependencies** (npm, pip, Maven, NuGet, etc.).  
- Cache **build artifacts** between runs.  
- Cache **Docker layers** when building images.

Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: Cache Node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
