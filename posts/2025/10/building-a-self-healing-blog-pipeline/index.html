Automation isn’t just for production systems — it’s for creators, too.  
In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built a **self-healing blog pipeline** powered by **GitHub Actions** and **PowerShell**, ensuring every update is validated, versioned, and deployed with confidence.

## The Challenge

Manually maintaining metadata for blog posts quickly becomes messy.  
Without checks in place, broken links, outdated feeds, or missing tags can slip through.

Common issues included:
- Mismatched front-matter fields  
- Invalid metadata or broken XML feeds  
- Push conflicts on the main branch during updates  

---

## The Solution

I automated everything — from content validation to deployment.  
Here’s the secret sauce:

1. **PowerShell scripts** handle front-matter correction, validation, and metadata regeneration.  
2. **GitHub Actions** run automatically on every push or manual trigger.  
3. **peter-evans/create-pull-request** safely commits metadata updates via PRs to avoid push errors.  

---

## Results

✅ No more failed deployments.  
✅ Every post auto-validates before publishing.  
✅ Metadata changes are tracked and reviewed.  

This is a lightweight but **production-grade pipeline** — the same principles powering CI/CD in large organizations, applied to personal publishing.

---

## Takeaway

Automation reduces friction and improves creativity.  
By letting scripts handle the technical chores, I can focus on writing — knowing my blog is self-healing, consistent, and reliable.
