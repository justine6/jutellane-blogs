          <strong>New DevOps Insights</strong> is the home for short, honest lessons
          from real systems — where Cloud, DevOps, AI, and sustainability meet the
          day-to-day work of shipping and operating software.

        <h2>Why this series exists</h2>
        <p>
          Most DevOps content falls into two extremes:
          glossy vendor decks or one-off war stories with no follow-through.
          This series sits in the middle. It’s a living notebook of patterns,
          anti-patterns, and “I wish I’d known this sooner” moments from real projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of rewriting the same ideas in every article, this page
          anchors what <em>New DevOps Insights</em> is about and how to read it.
        </p>

        <h2>The four pillars of these insights</h2>

        <h3>1. Cloud with intent</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud is not just “someone else’s computer.” It’s a toolbox for
          reliability, speed, and experimentation. Posts in this series look at:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing architectures that are <strong>observable and reversible</strong></li>
          <li>Choosing managed services without losing <strong>operational clarity</strong></li>
          <li>Cost-aware decisions that don’t break teams or the planet</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. DevOps as a practice, not a title</h3>
        <p>
          DevOps here means <strong>flow</strong>: how ideas move from notebooks
          to production safely and repeatably. You’ll see:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>CI/CD patterns that survive real-world messiness</li>
          <li>Release strategies for legacy systems and greenfield apps</li>
          <li>Playbooks for incidents, rollbacks, and learning reviews</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Observability and feedback loops</h3>
        <p>
          We can’t improve what we can’t see. Insights in this pillar focus on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Turning logs, metrics, and traces into <strong>decisions</strong></li>
          <li>Dashboards that tell stories, not just numbers</li>
          <li>Feedback loops between teams, tools, and stakeholders</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. AI &amp; sustainability in the stack</h3>
        <p>
          AI shows up here as a helper, not a magic trick — from code review
          assistants to smart alert routing. Sustainability shows up in the
          way we design:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pipelines that avoid wasteful re-work</li>
          <li>Infrastructure that is <strong>right-sized</strong>, not over-provisioned</li>
          <li>Practices that protect teams from burnout</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What you’ll find in each insight</h2>
        <p>Most posts in this series follow a simple pattern:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Context</strong> — the real situation or pain point</li>
          <li><strong>Signal</strong> — the metric, log, or symptom that mattered</li>
          <li><strong>Decision</strong> — the change we made and why</li>
          <li><strong>Payoff</strong> — how we measure whether it worked</li>
          <li><strong>Try this</strong> — a concrete action you can take this week</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Some will be tiny “1% better” tweaks. Others will be deep dives that
          sit alongside the long-form articles and project case studies.
        </p>

        <h2>Who this is for</h2>
        <p>
          If you live anywhere near infrastructure, delivery, or operations,
          this series is for you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud &amp; platform engineers</li>
          <li>DevOps / SRE / automation engineers</li>
          <li>Developers who care what happens <em>after</em> the merge</li>
          <li>Leads trying to align teams around better engineering habits</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to use these posts at work</h2>
        <p>
          You can treat each insight as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A prompt for a lunch-and-learn or team discussion</li>
          <li>A seed for your own playbooks and runbooks</li>
          <li>A checklist item in your next design review</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Feel free to reference them in design docs, onboarding material, or
          retrospectives. The goal is to make it easy to move from
          <strong>“we should do better”</strong> to
          <strong>“here’s a concrete next move.”</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>What’s next</h2>
        <p>
          As new lessons land — from experiments, outages, and quiet wins —
          they’ll join this stream. Over time, <em>New DevOps Insights</em> becomes
          a map of how Jutellane approaches Cloud, DevOps, AI, and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, pick the insight that speaks loudest to your current
          challenge, try one small change, and see what it unlocks.
